- Hello 👋, I’m Nhial Mawien
- 👀 About me..I am a data analyst with an educational background in Business Informatics and an enthusiasm for exploring and learning new things. 
During my Career Foundry course, I became experienced in data cleaning and analyzing in Excel, SQL, and Python. My curiosity drives me to uncover facts in the data sets and my sense of aesthetics to interpret and convey results through effective storytelling in Tableau.

 

I'm enthusiastic about new opportunities to enhance my skills.
